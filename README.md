# **AI Trip Planner**

AI Trip Planner is a FastAPI-based assistant that assembles detailed, tool-augmented itineraries and expense estimates using LangGraph, LangChain, and external data providers. Given a natural-language trip request, the agent researches attractions, activities, transportation, and costs, then returns a comprehensive Markdown itinerary plus a saved export for later reference.
